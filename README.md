### Rules for the game:
- All cells are initially empty.
- Players can place an atom/orb in either an empty cell or cell having the
atoms/orbs of their assigned color.
- When two or more atoms/orbs are placed in the same cell, they form a molecule/collection.
- Each cell has certain capacity to hold atoms. i.e. 4 for usual cells, 3 for cells in the 
edge and 2 for cells in the corner.
- When a cell reaches its capacity:
-- The molecule splits.
-- Adjacent cells receive one atom and gets converted to the same color.
-- The explosions might result in overloading of an adjacent cell and the 
chain reaction of explosion continues until every cell is stable.
- The winner is the one who eliminates every other player's orbs.
